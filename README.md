# Course Repository 2023 - Zoja Manček Páli
Data Science in Ecology and Environmental Science Course

## Course Repository Challenge Instructions - GitHub and version control

Challenge start time: Thurs 5 Oct 2023
Challenge end time: 12 noon Fri 1 Dec 2023

## Coding etiquette for this repository:
The following rules should be upheld at all times when coding or working in this repo:
1. Informative comments are included throughout the code, using the hashtag (#) symbol. There are no spaces before the hashtags. 
2. The code is spaced out to make it easier to read.
3. The work is broken down into sections (by adding ---- at the end of each section title).
4. All objects are given informative names (object names do not include capital leters and are separated by _ if necessary)
5. Keep your code to under 100 characters in length per line (comments can extend past that if necessary)

## What to include:
- Course readings - Up to you to decide how you'll organise those.
- Folders of each of the Data Science challenges
- Folders for each of the Coding Club tutorials
- A folder for the new tutorial (final assignment) you will make
- A master README.md file - Remember that you can't create empty folders and in addition to the README.md file for the whole repository, you might want to have README.md files for some of your subfolders as well to explain what the folder content will be.
- A repo etiquette file - Up to you to decide how that will be organised - will it be a separate file, inside the README.md file?
- A licence file - You need to provide a licence for your repository as a whole, as well as for any datasets you use.
- A data reference list - You might create a data catalogue that you update as you go with the sources, citations and the copyright of all the datasets you use. This might be a separate file, or you can incorporate it in the main licence file, up to you to think about what is best.

## What to include (suggestions to get you thinking more creatively):

- A folder for generic functions or any code you develop that you use throughout the course
- A folder for side projects/dissertation/other assignments
- Personal notes
- Figures folder
- Images folder for any photos/diagrams you might embed in Markdown files
- Working folder
- Practice scripts
- A doc folder
- An accidental art folder
- Workflow diagrams

Happy coding and version-controlling!
