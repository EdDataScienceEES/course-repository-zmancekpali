## Breakdown of the contents:
Each section of the course is split into individual folders:
  - [Coding club](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/course-repository-zmancekpali/tree/master/Coding%20Club) - this folder contains further subfolders for each week's CC class, including the data, script, and plots (if any).
  - [Challenges](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/course-repository-zmancekpali/tree/master/Data%20Science%20Challenges) - this folder contains further subfolders for each DS challenge, including the data, scripts, plots, and respective licences.
  - [Tutorial](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/course-repository-zmancekpali/tree/master/Data%20Science%20Tutorial) - this folder contains further subfolders for the DS Tutorial, including the data, scripts, plots, and the respective licence.
  - [Weekly in-class content](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/course-repository-zmancekpali/tree/master/Weekly%20DS%20content) - this folder contains further subfolders for each week's in-class activity.
  - [Dissertation](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/course-repository-zmancekpali/tree/master/Dissertation) - this folder contains my dissertation plan, the current script (a work in progress), and any plots made so far. 
  - [Additional files](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/course-repository-zmancekpali/tree/master/Other%20useful%20content) - this folder contains miscelaneous other folders like useful functions, the statistics assessment, and a morale boost for when you've looked at the computer for far too long and would like to be outside instead.

## Coding etiquette for this repository:
The following rules should be upheld at all times when coding or working in this repo:
1. Informative comments are included throughout the code, using the hashtag (#) symbol. There are no spaces before the hashtags. 
2. The code is spaced out to make it easier to read.
3. The work is broken down into sections (by adding ---- at the end of each section title if necessary).
4. All objects are given informative names (object names do not include capital leters and are separated by _ if necessary).
5. Keep your code to under 100 characters in length per line (comments can extend past that if necessary).
